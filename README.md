# Mach-L4N1

## Mother's Day
The Mach-L4N1 is the final iteration of the Iron Man suit, in the one possible reality of victory, as a gift for the one and only Leilani Garcia Flores, the reason that I even got started in Computer Science in the first place. Love you mom, Happy Mother's Day~

## Creation
There were several iterations of Mach-L4N1 over the 10 hour time period of IEEE Hacks, here is a breakdown of each.

### Mach-1
The Mach-1 has a basic strategy, with three different modes.

1. Expansion - Build energy wells on high energy locations & pick high energy/low cost cells to attack

2. Capitalize - Build gold mines on high gold locations & pick high gold/low cost cells to attack

3. All Spark - Build resource multipliers & upgrade them while attacking the quickest cells

### Mach-2
The Mach-2 has the same basic stages for Expansion & Capitlize, but during the All Spark mode, it randomly chooses to decimate enemy gold mines, enemy energy wells, or expand rapidly. It also has a method for destroying enemy bases completely.

### Mach-3
The Mach-3 has a defensive strategy which will attack its own cells to protect territories which are near the edge instead of spending gold on fortresses.

### Mach-L4N1
The Mach-L4N1 allows for an interactive mode with the user to have micro control so that a human element can act as a fitness function for prioritizing expansion or holding still.
